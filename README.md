## Updating Lifecycle Methods

- `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
  - This lifecycle method is called when state of the component depends on changes in props over time
  - This method is called every time a component is re-renderd
  - As it's static method therefore it does not have access to `this` context and we can not make use of `this.setState`, we need to simply return an `Object` that represent the new state.
  - Do not cause side effects.
    - Side effect means interact with DOM or perform any AJAX calls to load data
- `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
  - It dictates if component should re-render or not.
  - By default all class components will re-render whenever the props they recieve or their state changes, this method can prevent that default behaviour by returning `false`. Thus, this method is specifically for optimization.
  - Do not cause side effects
    - Side effect means interact with DOM or perform any AJAX calls to load data
- `render`
  - Only required method in component
  - Read props & state and return JSX which describe the UI.
  - render function is a pure function.
  - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make AJAX calls.
  - Children components lifecycle methods are also executed.
- `getSnapShotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
   - Called right before the changes from Virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM
   - Use case: We could use this method to capture some information from the DOM like: We may want to read user's scroll position and after the update maintain the scroll position by performing some calculation.
  - This method will either return null or value. Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method. 
 - `componentDidUpdate(prevProp, prevState, snapshotValue)`
   - It's called after the render is finished in the re-render cycle.
   - We may cause side effects inside it.
